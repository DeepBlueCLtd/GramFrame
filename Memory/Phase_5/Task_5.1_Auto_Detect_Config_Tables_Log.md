# Task 5.1: Auto-detect and replace config tables

This log tracks the implementation of auto-detection and replacement of config tables for the GramFrame component.

## [2025-07-18T16:10:00+01:00] - Task Initialization

### Context
Task 5.1 involves implementing functionality to automatically detect HTML tables with the class "spectro-config" and replace them with the GramFrame component.

### Action
Task initialized as part of the Implementation Plan. This file has been created to track progress.

### Outcome
Log file established. Implementation will begin when assigned to an Implementation Agent.

### Next Steps
1. Implement a document scan for tables with the "spectro-config" class
2. Create a function to extract configuration from the table
3. Replace each table with a GramFrame component instance
4. Ensure proper initialization with extracted configuration
5. Add error handling for malformed tables
