# Task 3.1: Add mouse move tracking

This log tracks the implementation of mouse move tracking functionality for the GramFrame component.

## [2025-07-18T16:08:00+01:00] - Task Initialization

### Context
Task 3.1 involves adding mouse move tracking to the GramFrame component to enable cursor position detection over the spectrogram image.

### Action
Task initialized as part of the Implementation Plan. This file has been created to track progress.

### Outcome
Log file established. Implementation will begin when assigned to an Implementation Agent.

### Next Steps
1. Add event listeners for mouse movement on the canvas
2. Calculate relative position within the canvas
3. Update component state with mouse coordinates
4. Ensure coordinates are normalized to the spectrogram dimensions
