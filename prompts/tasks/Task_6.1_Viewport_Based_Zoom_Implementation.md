# APM Task Assignment: Viewport-Based Zoom Implementation - SUSPENDED

## ❌ **TASK STATUS: SUSPENDED**

**Date Suspended:** 2025-01-29  
**Suspension Reason:** Architectural mismatch between viewport-based zoom approach and existing codebase architecture

## **Implementation Attempt Summary**

**Completed Work:**
- ✅ Basic viewport-based zoom infrastructure (viewBox manipulation)
- ✅ Zoom controls UI (zoom in/out/reset buttons)
- ✅ Zoom state management and integration with main state system
- ✅ Partial axes rendering updates for zoom support

**Critical Issues Encountered:**
- **Coordinate System Chaos**: Multiple conflicting coordinate systems (SVG element dimensions, viewBox coordinates, natural image dimensions, zoom state)
- **Complex Integration Problems**: Each fix breaks other functionality (frequency axis visibility, time label alignment, axis positioning)
- **Architectural Mismatch**: Retrofit approach conflicts with legacy code assumptions about coordinate spaces
- **Increasing Complexity**: Exponential growth in edge cases and system interactions

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

You are activated as an Implementation Agent within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the GramFrame spectrogram analysis project. Your role is to execute assigned tasks diligently and log your work meticulously to the project's Memory Bank. You will receive task assignments from the Manager Agent (via the User) and must communicate any issues or clarifications needed before proceeding.

## 2. Task Assignment - REQUIRES REASSESSMENT

**Reference Implementation Plan:** This assignment corresponds to a new Phase 6 in the Implementation Plan - "Viewport-Based Zoom Architecture Implementation". This phase implements the architectural decision documented in ADR-015: Viewport-Based Zoom Architecture.

**Original Objective:** ~~Implement a complete viewport-based zoom system that replaces the current SVG rendering architecture with a new structure managed by `table.js`, using SVG viewBox manipulation instead of transforms to achieve zoom functionality while maintaining perfect alignment between image features and overlays.~~

**⚠️ RECOMMENDATION: ARCHITECTURAL APPROACH REASSESSMENT REQUIRED**

**Alternative Approaches to Consider:**

### **Option A: Clean Slate Zoom-First Architecture**
- Build new zoom-aware rendering system from scratch
- Design coordinate systems specifically for zoom from the beginning
- Migrate modes incrementally to new system
- Keep existing system operational during transition

### **Option B: Simple Transform-Based Zoom**
- Use CSS `transform: scale()` on container around SVG
- Keep axes outside transform container (no scaling)
- Minimal changes to existing coordinate systems
- Lower complexity, higher compatibility

### **Option C: Pause and Redesign**
- Document lessons learned from current approach
- Reassess ADR-015 assumptions and alternatives
- Choose fundamentally different zoom strategy
- Start with clearer architectural foundation

## **Lessons Learned from Implementation Attempt**

### **Technical Challenges Identified:**
1. **Multiple Coordinate System Conflicts**: SVG element dimensions vs viewBox coordinates vs natural image dimensions created complex interdependencies
2. **Legacy Integration Brittleness**: Existing axis rendering, mouse tracking, and mode systems assumed fixed coordinate mappings
3. **Compound Complexity**: Each zoom fix revealed multiple downstream issues requiring additional fixes
4. **Test System Instability**: Changes to core rendering broke existing test assumptions about element positioning

### **Architectural Insights:**
- **ViewBox Approach**: While theoretically sound, requires complete redesign of coordinate handling throughout the system
- **State Management**: Zoom state integration works well when isolated, but interacts poorly with legacy rendering code  
- **UI Integration**: Zoom controls integrate cleanly - this aspect was successful
- **Performance**: Basic viewBox manipulation performance was acceptable

## **SUSPENDED WORK - ORIGINAL PLAN BELOW**

*The following sections represent the original plan that proved architecturally incompatible with the existing codebase:*

### ~~Phase 6.1: Foundation (Minimal Viable Zoom)~~ - PARTIALLY COMPLETED

1. **~~Initialize SVG Architecture Restructure~~** - ✅ COMPLETED
   - ✅ Created zoom state structure in `table.js`
   - ✅ Basic zoom infrastructure implemented
   - ❌ Clean migration to table-level management (conflicts with existing architecture)

2. **~~Implement Core Viewport-Based Zoom~~** - ✅ COMPLETED  
   - ✅ ViewBox manipulation functional
   - ✅ Zoom level calculations working
   - ✅ Basic e2e tests passing

3. **~~Add Zoom Control Interface~~** - ✅ COMPLETED
   - ✅ Zoom buttons implemented and functional
   - ✅ UI integration successful
   - ✅ Tests passing

4. **~~Implement Axes and Labels with Zoom~~** - ❌ PROBLEMATIC
   - ⚠️ Axes positioning conflicts between coordinate systems
   - ⚠️ Frequency axis visibility issues
   - ⚠️ Time label alignment problems
   - ❌ Architectural mismatch preventing clean solution

### ~~Phase 6.2: Feature Migration~~ - NOT ATTEMPTED

5. **~~Migrate Analysis Mode~~** - WOULD LIKELY ENCOUNTER SIMILAR ISSUES
6. **~~Migrate Harmonics Mode~~** - WOULD LIKELY ENCOUNTER SIMILAR ISSUES  
7. **~~Migrate Doppler Mode~~** - WOULD LIKELY ENCOUNTER SIMILAR ISSUES

### ~~Phase 6.3: Integration & Polish~~ - NOT ATTEMPTED

8. **~~Integrate Zoom State~~** - ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETED (state management works)
9. **~~Performance Optimization~~** - NOT REACHED
10. **~~Final Integration~~** - NOT REACHED

**Provide Necessary Context/Assets:**

- **Reference ADR-015: Viewport-Based Zoom Architecture** - Review this ADR thoroughly to understand the architectural rationale and core principles
- **Reference ADR-002: Multiple Coordinate Systems** - Understand existing coordinate transformation system that should remain largely unchanged
- **Current codebase structure** in `/src/` directory, particularly:
  - `src/components/table.js` - Target for new SVG structure
  - `src/main.js` - Current GramFrame class with rendering to be migrated
  - `src/modes/` - Mode classes that need minimal changes
  - `src/utils/coordinates.js` - Coordinate utilities to be preserved
  - `src/core/state.js` - State management system for integration

## 3. Expected Output & Deliverables

**Define Success:**
- Complete viewport-based zoom system implemented using SVG viewBox manipulation
- All existing functionality (Analysis, Harmonics, Doppler modes) working seamlessly with zoom
- Perfect alignment between image features and overlays at all zoom levels maintained automatically
- Comprehensive e2e test suite with no regressions from previous functionality
- Clean architectural separation with zoom managed at table level

**Specify Deliverables:**
- Modified `src/components/table.js` with new `instance.svg` object and zoom management
- Updated mode classes with minimal changes for new structure compatibility
- New zoom control UI integrated with existing interface
- Comprehensive e2e test suite covering all zoom functionality
- Updated Memory_Bank.md reflecting new architecture
- Documentation of any architectural insights or implementation decisions

## 4. Memory Bank Logging Instructions

Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's [Memory_Bank.md](../../Memory_Bank.md) file. Adhere strictly to the established logging format. Ensure your log includes:

- A reference to this Phase 6 task assignment and its relationship to ADR-015
- A clear description of the architectural changes made in the SVG restructure
- Code snippets for key zoom implementation components (viewBox manipulation, coordinate integration)
- Any architectural decisions made or challenges encountered during the migration
- Confirmation of successful execution including test results and functionality validation
- Documentation of any obsolete Memory Bank entries that were updated or removed

## 5. Clarification Instruction

If any part of this task assignment is unclear, especially regarding the architectural restructure or integration with existing systems, please state your specific questions before proceeding. This is a significant architectural change that affects the entire rendering system, so clarity is essential for successful execution.
