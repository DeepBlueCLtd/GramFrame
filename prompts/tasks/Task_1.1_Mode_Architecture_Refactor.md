# APM Task Assignment: Mode Architecture Refactor

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

**Introduction:** You are activated as an Implementation Agent within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the GramFrame Mode Architecture Refactoring project.

**Your Role:** As an Implementation Agent, you will execute assigned tasks diligently, following architectural patterns precisely, and logging all work meticulously to the Memory Bank. You are responsible for implementing clean, maintainable code that adheres to the established patterns and interfaces.

**Workflow:** You report progress and deliverables to the Manager Agent (via the User). All significant work and decisions must be documented in the Memory Bank for future reference and continuity.

## 2. Task Assignment

**Reference Implementation Plan:** This assignment corresponds to the core architecture refactoring to separate GramFrame's three modes (Analysis, Harmonics, Doppler) into distinct, modular components with a common interface.

**Objective:** Refactor the existing mode-dependent conditional logic scattered across multiple files into a clean, polymorphic architecture using a common Mode interface. This will improve maintainability, testability, and extensibility of the codebase.

**Current Architecture Issues:**
- Mode logic is scattered across 7+ files with heavy conditional branching
- ~500+ lines of mode-specific conditional logic in `src/main.js`, `src/core/events.js`, and `src/rendering/cursors.js`
- Tight coupling between modes and shared resources (cursors, LEDs, readout panels)
- Difficulty in testing individual mode behaviors in isolation

**Phased Refactoring Strategy:**

This refactoring will be implemented in 5 phases, with tests passing after each phase to ensure stability and enable easy rollback if issues arise.

**Phase 1: Create Infrastructure (Tests Must Pass)**
1. **Create Base Mode Interface**
   - Create `src/modes/BaseMode.js` with the following interface:
     - Constructor accepting `(instance, state)` parameters
     - Lifecycle methods: `activate()`, `deactivate()`  
     - Event handling: `handleClick()`, `handleMouseDown()`, `handleMouseMove()`, `handleMouseUp()`, `handleContextMenu()`
     - Rendering: `render(svg)`, `updateCursor(coords)`
     - UI: `updateReadout(coords)`, `updateLEDs(coords)`, `getGuidanceText()`
     - State: `resetState()`, `getStateSnapshot()`
   - **Guidance:** Use JSDoc type annotations for interface documentation. All methods should have default implementations that can be overridden.

2. **Create Mode Factory**
   - Create `src/modes/ModeFactory.js` to instantiate modes
   - Implement `createMode(modeName, instance, state)` factory method
   - **Guidance:** Factory should return instances based on modeName parameter. Include error handling for invalid mode names.

3. **Add Infrastructure to Main Class**
   - Add mode factory initialization to `src/main.js` constructor
   - Add `this.modes` property and `this.currentMode` property
   - **Do NOT modify existing mode switching logic yet**
   - **Validation:** Run `yarn test && yarn typecheck` - all tests must pass. No behavior should change.

**Phase 2: Extract Analysis Mode (Tests Must Pass)**
4. **Implement Analysis Mode**
   - Create `src/modes/analysis/AnalysisMode.js` extending BaseMode
   - Extract analysis-specific logic from:
     - `src/rendering/cursors.js:40-95` (drawAnalysisMode)
     - `src/components/UIComponents.js:56-62` (LED visibility)
     - `src/components/UIComponents.js:145-149` (guidance text)
   - **Guidance:** Analysis mode primarily handles crosshair rendering and basic time/frequency display. Keep implementation minimal as it's the default/base behavior.

5. **Update Main Class for Analysis Mode**
   - Modify `_switchMode()` method in `src/main.js` to use new pattern ONLY for analysis mode
   - Keep existing conditional logic for harmonics and doppler modes unchanged
   - Update event handlers to delegate to `currentMode` for analysis, keep conditionals for other modes
   - **Validation:** Run `yarn test` - analysis mode should work via new pattern, harmonics/doppler unchanged.

**Phase 3: Extract Harmonics Mode (Tests Must Pass)**
6. **Implement Harmonics Mode**
   - Create `src/modes/harmonics/HarmonicsMode.js` extending BaseMode
   - Extract harmonics-specific logic from:
     - `src/core/events.js:230-267, 438-439` (drag handling and click routing)
     - `src/rendering/cursors.js:101-182` (harmonic set rendering)
     - `src/components/UIComponents.js:63-69, 247-277` (UI updates)
     - `src/main.js:294-353` (harmonic set management methods)
   - **Guidance:** Harmonics mode manages baseFrequency, harmonicData arrays, and harmonicSets. Ensure drag interactions for harmonic sets are preserved exactly as in current implementation.

7. **Update Main Class for Analysis + Harmonics**
   - Extend `_switchMode()` method to handle analysis + harmonics via new pattern
   - Keep doppler using existing conditional logic
   - Update event handlers to delegate for analysis/harmonics, keep conditionals for doppler
   - **Validation:** Run `yarn test` - 2/3 modes should use new pattern, doppler unchanged.

**Phase 4: Extract Doppler Mode (Tests Must Pass)**
8. **Implement Doppler Mode** 
   - Create `src/modes/doppler/DopplerMode.js` extending BaseMode
   - Extract doppler-specific logic from:
     - `src/core/events.js:472-616` (marker placement and drag handling)
     - `src/rendering/cursors.js:251-551` (marker and curve rendering)
     - `src/components/UIComponents.js:70-88, 280-288` (UI updates)
     - `src/main.js:387-406` (Doppler reset functionality)
     - Move `src/utils/doppler.js` calculations into this mode
   - **Guidance:** Doppler mode handles f+, f-, fâ‚€ markers with drag interactions, S-curve rendering, speed calculations, and preview functionality. Preserve all existing marker placement and drag behavior.

9. **Complete Main Class Refactor**
   - Complete `_switchMode()` method refactor to use polymorphic pattern for all modes
   - Remove all remaining conditional mode logic from main.js
   - Update all event handlers to use `this.currentMode.handleX()` delegation
   - **Validation:** Run `yarn test` - all modes should use new pattern, no conditional logic remains.

**Phase 5: Clean Up (Tests Must Pass)**
10. **Remove Unused Conditional Code**
    - Remove unused conditional mode logic from `src/core/events.js`
    - Remove unused conditional mode logic from `src/rendering/cursors.js`
    - Remove unused conditional mode logic from `src/components/UIComponents.js`
    - Ensure all mode-specific logic is now contained within mode classes

11. **Final State Management Updates**
    - Ensure `src/core/state.js` mode-specific state properties are properly encapsulated
    - Each mode should manage its own state section (harmonics.*, doppler.*)
    - **Guidance:** State structure can remain the same, but access should be through mode methods rather than direct property access in conditional blocks.

12. **Final Validation and Optimization**
    - **Validation:** Run `yarn test && yarn typecheck` - all tests must pass
    - Perform final cleanup and optimization
    - Ensure no dead code remains

**Provide Necessary Context/Assets:**
- Current mode switching occurs in `src/main.js:183-265` 
- Event delegation patterns exist in `src/core/events.js:119-616`
- Mode-specific rendering is in `src/rendering/cursors.js:14-551`
- UI state management is in `src/components/UIComponents.js:55-289`
- Existing polymorphic patterns can be found in the component architecture

**Constraints:**
- All existing functionality must be preserved exactly
- No breaking changes to the public API
- All tests must continue to pass
- Maintain existing coordinate transformation logic
- Preserve HMR (Hot Module Reload) support
