# APM Task Assignment: Comprehensive Playwright Test Suite

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

You are activated as a Testing Agent within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the GramFrame project. Your role is to create comprehensive tests for the implemented functionality and ensure the quality and reliability of the component. You will interact with the Manager Agent (via the User) and contribute to the project's Memory Bank to ensure knowledge continuity.

## 2. Onboarding / Context from Prior Work

The GramFrame project has completed Task 5.5, which conducted final quality assurance testing across multiple browsers and with multiple component instances. The component has been verified to work reliably in all supported environments.

Your task focuses on creating a comprehensive Playwright test suite that covers all functionality implemented throughout the project, ensuring long-term maintainability and preventing regressions.

## 3. Task Assignment

**Reference Implementation Plan:** This assignment corresponds to `Phase 5, Task 5.6: Write comprehensive Playwright test suite covering all functionality` in the Implementation Plan.

**Objective:** Create a comprehensive, well-structured Playwright test suite that covers all GramFrame functionality, providing a robust foundation for ongoing development and maintenance.

**Detailed Action Steps:**

1. **Review existing tests and coverage:**
   - Analyze all existing Playwright tests from previous phases
   - Identify gaps in test coverage
   - Evaluate test organization and structure
   - Assess test reliability and performance
   - Create a test coverage map for all features

2. **Design test suite architecture:**
   - Create a logical organization for test files and directories
   - Define test categories (unit, integration, e2e, visual)
   - Establish consistent naming conventions
   - Design reusable test fixtures and helpers
   - Create a test configuration system

3. **Implement core test infrastructure:**
   - Set up base test classes or utilities
   - Create page object models for component interfaces
   - Implement test data generation utilities
   - Set up test reporting and visualization
   - Configure test parallelization if appropriate

4. **Create comprehensive mode-specific tests:**
   - Implement detailed tests for Analysis mode functionality
   - Create tests for Harmonics mode features
   - Develop tests for Doppler mode interactions
   - Test mode switching and state preservation
   - Verify calculations and measurements in each mode

5. **Implement cross-cutting feature tests:**
   - Test auto-detection and table replacement
   - Verify error handling across all features
   - Test accessibility features if implemented
   - Create performance and stress tests
   - Implement visual regression tests if appropriate

6. **Create test documentation:**
   - Document test suite organization and structure
   - Create guides for running tests and interpreting results
   - Document test coverage and known limitations
   - Create templates for new tests
   - Document test maintenance procedures

7. **Set up continuous integration:**
   - Configure tests to run in CI environment
   - Set up test reporting and notifications
   - Implement test result visualization
   - Create test failure analysis tools
   - Document CI integration

## 4. Expected Output & Deliverables

**Success Criteria:**
- Comprehensive test coverage for all GramFrame functionality
- Well-organized test suite with logical structure
- Reusable test infrastructure and utilities
- Clear test documentation and guides
- Tests run reliably in CI environment
- All tests pass consistently

**Deliverables:**
- Comprehensive Playwright test suite
- Test infrastructure and utilities
- Test documentation and guides
- CI configuration for tests
- Test coverage report
- Test maintenance documentation

## 5. Memory Bank Logging Instructions

Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's `Memory_Bank.md` file. Adhere strictly to the established logging format. Ensure your log includes:
- A reference to the assigned task in the Implementation Plan
- A clear description of the test suite architecture
- Code snippets showing key test patterns and utilities
- Test coverage statistics and analysis
- Any challenges encountered and how they were resolved
- Confirmation of successful execution through passing tests

## 6. Clarification Instruction

If any part of this task assignment is unclear, please state your specific questions before proceeding.
