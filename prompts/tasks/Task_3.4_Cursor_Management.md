# APM Task Assignment: Cursor Management

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

You are activated as an Implementation Agent within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the GramFrame project. Your role is to execute the assigned task diligently and log your work meticulously. You will interact with the Manager Agent (via the User) and contribute to the project's Memory Bank to ensure knowledge continuity.

## 2. Onboarding / Context from Prior Work

The GramFrame project has successfully completed:
- Task 3.1: SVG Container Implementation - providing an SVG container with coordinate transformation support
- Task 3.2: Mouse Tracking - implementing mouse movement tracking and coordinate conversion
- Task 3.3: Time/Frequency Cursor Display - showing cursor position with visual indicators and LED display updates

The component now displays the current cursor position with visual indicators and updates the LED display with time and frequency values. Your task builds on this foundation by implementing persistent cursor management, allowing users to add and manipulate cursors on the spectrogram.

## 3. Task Assignment

**Reference Implementation Plan:** This assignment corresponds to `Phase 3, Task 4: Cursor Management` in the Implementation Plan.

**Objective:** Implement click handling to add cursors, drag functionality to reposition cursors, and state management for multiple cursors.

**Detailed Action Steps:**

1. **Implement click handling to add cursors:**
   - Add event listeners for mouse clicks on the SVG container
   - When a click is detected, create a new cursor at that position
   - Generate a unique identifier for each cursor
   - Store cursor data (position, id, etc.) in the component state
   - Create SVG elements to visually represent the persistent cursors
   - Style cursors distinctly from the hover indicator

2. **Add drag functionality to reposition cursors:**
   - Implement mousedown, mousemove, and mouseup event handling for drag operations
   - Detect when a user clicks on an existing cursor
   - Update cursor position during drag operations
   - Ensure smooth visual feedback during dragging
   - Complete the drag operation when the mouse is released
   - Update the cursor's position in the component state

3. **Manage multiple cursors in state:**
   - Design a data structure to efficiently store multiple cursor positions
   - Extend the component state to handle an array of cursors
   - Implement methods to add, update, and remove cursors
   - Ensure each cursor maintains its own time and frequency values
   - Optimize state updates to prevent unnecessary re-renders

4. **Write integration tests:**
   - Create Playwright tests for cursor addition via clicking
   - Test drag functionality to verify cursors can be repositioned
   - Verify state management with multiple cursors
   - Test edge cases (e.g., rapid clicks, dragging outside bounds)
   - Ensure all existing functionality continues to work with cursor management
   - Fix any broken integration tests before proceeding to the next task

## 4. Expected Output & Deliverables

**Success Criteria:**
- Users can click to add persistent cursors to the spectrogram
- Cursors can be dragged to new positions
- Multiple cursors can exist simultaneously
- The component state correctly manages cursor data
- Visual representation of cursors is clear and distinct
- All integration tests pass

**Deliverables:**
- Click handling implementation for cursor creation
- Drag functionality for cursor repositioning
- State management for multiple cursors
- Visual representation of cursors
- Integration tests for all new functionality

## 5. Memory Bank Logging Instructions

Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's `Memory_Bank.md` file. Adhere strictly to the established logging format. Ensure your log includes:
- A reference to the assigned task in the Implementation Plan
- A clear description of the cursor management implementation
- Code snippets showing the click handling, drag functionality, and state management
- Any challenges encountered and how they were resolved
- Confirmation of successful execution through passing tests

## 6. Clarification Instruction

If any part of this task assignment is unclear, please state your specific questions before proceeding.
