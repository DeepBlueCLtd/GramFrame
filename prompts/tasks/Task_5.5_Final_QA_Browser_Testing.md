# APM Task Assignment: Final QA and Browser Matrix Testing

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

You are activated as an Implementation Agent within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the GramFrame project. Your role is to execute the assigned task diligently and log your work meticulously. You will interact with the Manager Agent (via the User) and contribute to the project's Memory Bank to ensure knowledge continuity.

## 2. Onboarding / Context from Prior Work

The GramFrame project has completed Task 5.4, which implemented comprehensive error handling throughout the component. The component now has robust error handling for various scenarios, providing meaningful feedback to users and developers.

Your task focuses on conducting final quality assurance testing across multiple browsers and with multiple component instances to ensure the component works reliably in all supported environments.

## 3. Task Assignment

**Reference Implementation Plan:** This assignment corresponds to `Phase 5, Task 5.5: Final QA: browser matrix, multi-instance test` in the Implementation Plan.

**Objective:** Conduct comprehensive quality assurance testing across multiple browsers and with multiple component instances on the same page to ensure the GramFrame component works reliably in all supported environments.

**Detailed Action Steps:**

1. **Define browser test matrix:**
   - Identify target browsers for testing (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Define minimum supported versions for each browser
   - Include mobile browsers if relevant (e.g., iOS Safari, Chrome for Android)
   - Create a testing checklist for each browser
   - Document any known browser-specific issues or limitations

2. **Set up browser testing environment:**
   - Configure Playwright for cross-browser testing
   - Set up browser instances for each target browser
   - Create test pages with various configurations
   - Implement logging for browser-specific information
   - Set up screenshots or video recording for test sessions

3. **Implement multi-instance test scenarios:**
   - Create test pages with multiple GramFrame instances
   - Test different configurations for each instance
   - Verify that instances don't interfere with each other
   - Test performance with multiple active instances
   - Verify state isolation between instances

4. **Conduct feature testing across browsers:**
   - Test all three modes (Analysis, Harmonics, Doppler) in each browser
   - Verify that UI elements render correctly across browsers
   - Test mouse interactions and event handling
   - Verify calculations and measurements are consistent
   - Test edge cases specific to each browser

5. **Perform performance testing:**
   - Measure rendering performance across browsers
   - Test with various image sizes and resolutions
   - Measure memory usage with prolonged use
   - Test performance with multiple instances
   - Identify and address performance bottlenecks

6. **Create compatibility documentation:**
   - Document browser compatibility results
   - Note any browser-specific limitations or issues
   - Create a compatibility matrix for reference
   - Document recommended browser settings
   - Add browser requirements to the component documentation

7. **Address browser-specific issues:**
   - Implement workarounds for browser-specific bugs
   - Add polyfills for missing features if needed
   - Optimize rendering for specific browsers if necessary
   - Test fixes across all browsers to ensure no regressions
   - Document any remaining known issues

## 4. Expected Output & Deliverables

**Success Criteria:**
- GramFrame component works correctly in all target browsers
- Multiple instances function properly on the same page
- Performance is acceptable across all browsers
- All features work consistently across browsers
- Browser-specific issues are addressed or documented
- Comprehensive compatibility documentation is created

**Deliverables:**
- Browser test matrix and results
- Multi-instance test results
- Performance test results
- Browser compatibility documentation
- Fixes for browser-specific issues
- Updated component documentation with browser requirements

## 5. Memory Bank Logging Instructions

Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's `Memory_Bank.md` file. Adhere strictly to the established logging format. Ensure your log includes:
- A reference to the assigned task in the Implementation Plan
- A clear description of the browser testing methodology
- A summary of the test results across browsers
- Details of any browser-specific issues and their resolutions
- Performance metrics across browsers
- Confirmation of successful multi-instance testing

## 6. Clarification Instruction

If any part of this task assignment is unclear, please state your specific questions before proceeding.
