# APM Task Assignment: State Listener and Diagnostics Updates

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

You are activated as an Implementation Agent within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the GramFrame project. Your role is to execute the assigned task diligently and log your work meticulously. You will interact with the Manager Agent (via the User) and contribute to the project's Memory Bank to ensure knowledge continuity.

## 2. Onboarding / Context from Prior Work

The GramFrame project has successfully completed:
- Task 3.1: SVG Container Implementation - providing an SVG container with coordinate transformation support
- Task 3.2: Mouse Tracking - implementing mouse movement tracking and coordinate conversion
- Task 3.3: Time/Frequency Cursor Display - showing cursor position with visual indicators and LED display updates
- Task 3.4: Cursor Management - allowing users to add, reposition, and manage multiple cursors

The component now has full cursor management capabilities, allowing users to add and manipulate cursors on the spectrogram. Your task builds on this foundation by extending the state listener mechanism to include cursor information and updating the diagnostics panel to display cursor details.

## 3. Task Assignment

**Reference Implementation Plan:** This assignment corresponds to `Phase 3, Task 5: State Listener and Diagnostics Updates` in the Implementation Plan.

**Objective:** Extend the state listener mechanism to include cursor information and update the diagnostics panel to show cursor details.

**Detailed Action Steps:**

1. **Extend state listener to include cursor information:**
   - Review the existing state listener implementation from Phase 2
   - Enhance the state listener to capture and provide cursor-related state changes
   - Ensure the listener reports:
     - Cursor creation events
     - Cursor position updates
     - Cursor deletion events
     - Current cursor count
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing listener functionality
   - Use TypeScript interfaces to define the structure of cursor state data

2. **Update diagnostics panel to show cursor details:**
   - Enhance the diagnostics panel to display information about all active cursors
   - For each cursor, show:
     - Cursor ID
     - Time value (with appropriate formatting)
     - Frequency value (with appropriate formatting)
     - Any additional relevant metadata
   - Implement real-time updates of the diagnostics panel when cursors change
   - Ensure the panel remains readable with multiple cursors
   - Add a section showing the total number of cursors

3. **Create comprehensive integration tests:**
   - Implement Playwright tests for the extended state listener functionality
   - Test that the diagnostics panel updates correctly with cursor changes
   - Verify that all cursor events are properly captured by listeners
   - Test with multiple cursors to ensure the system scales properly
   - Ensure all existing functionality continues to work with the enhanced listeners
   - Fix any broken integration tests before considering the task complete

## 4. Expected Output & Deliverables

**Success Criteria:**
- State listeners receive comprehensive cursor information
- The diagnostics panel displays detailed information about all cursors
- Real-time updates occur when cursors are added, moved, or removed
- The system handles multiple cursors efficiently
- All integration tests pass

**Deliverables:**
- Enhanced state listener implementation
- Updated diagnostics panel with cursor information display
- Integration tests for all new functionality

## 5. Memory Bank Logging Instructions

Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's `Memory_Bank.md` file. Adhere strictly to the established logging format. Ensure your log includes:
- A reference to the assigned task in the Implementation Plan
- A clear description of the state listener enhancements and diagnostics panel updates
- Code snippets showing the key implementations
- Any challenges encountered and how they were resolved
- Confirmation of successful execution through passing tests

## 6. Clarification Instruction

If any part of this task assignment is unclear, please state your specific questions before proceeding.
