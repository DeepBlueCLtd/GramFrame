# APM Task Assignment: Rename Analysis Mode to Cross Cursor in UI

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

* **Introduction:** You are activated as an Implementation Agent within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the GramFrame project.
* **Your Role:** Execute assigned tasks diligently and log work meticulously to ensure proper documentation and continuity.
* **Workflow:** You will interact with the Manager Agent (via the User) and maintain comprehensive records in the Memory Bank for future reference.

## 2. Task Assignment

* **Reference GitHub Issue:** This assignment addresses GitHub Issue #65: "Change the name `Analysis` to `Cross Cursor`" from the upstream repository https://github.com/DeepBlueCLtd/GramFrame/issues/65
* **Objective:** Rename the "Analysis" mode to "Cross Cursor" in the user interface while maintaining all existing functionality and preserving the internal `analysis` terminology in source code and documentation.

* **Detailed Action Steps:**
  1. **Identify UI Display Components:**
     - Locate all UI components that display the mode name "Analysis" to users
     - Focus on mode switching buttons, labels, and any user-facing text
     - Key files to examine: `src/components/ModeButtons.js`, `src/components/UIComponents.js`
  
  2. **Update Mode Display Labels:**
     - Change user-facing display text from "Analysis" to "Cross Cursor"
     - Ensure the change only affects UI display, not internal mode identifiers
     - Maintain the internal `analysis` mode identifier in code
  
  3. **Verify Scope Limitation:**
     - Confirm that internal code references to `analysis` mode remain unchanged
     - Ensure system documentation continues to use `analysis` terminology
     - Only modify user-visible interface elements

* **Provide Necessary Context/Assets:**
  - **Architecture Context:** This is a UI-only change that maintains the existing mode system architecture as defined in the modular mode system (reference docs/ADRs/ if needed for understanding mode structure)
  - **Key Files to Examine:**
    - `src/components/ModeButtons.js` - Likely contains mode switching interface
    - `src/components/UIComponents.js` - May contain mode display components
    - `src/modes/analysis/AnalysisMode.js` - Review to understand internal mode structure (do not modify)
  - **Constraints:** 
    - This is a UI-only change - do not modify internal mode identifiers or logic
    - Preserve all existing functionality and behavior
    - Maintain consistency with the established mode switching patterns

## 3. Expected Output & Deliverables

* **Define Success:** The "Analysis" mode is successfully renamed to "Cross Cursor" in all user-facing interface elements while maintaining complete functionality and preserving internal code structure.
* **Specify Deliverables:**
  - Modified UI component files with updated display text
  - Verification that mode switching and functionality remain intact
  - Confirmation that internal `analysis` references are preserved
* **Testing Requirements:** Ensure mode switching works correctly and the new name displays properly in all relevant UI components.

## 4. Memory Bank Logging Instructions

* **Instruction:** Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's [Memory_Bank.md](../../Memory_Bank.md) file.
* **Format Adherence:** Adhere strictly to the established logging format. Ensure your log includes:
  - A reference to GitHub Issue #65 and this task assignment
  - A clear description of the UI components modified
  - Code snippets showing the specific changes made
  - Confirmation that functionality remains intact after the rename
  - Any testing performed to verify the changes

## 5. Clarification Instruction

* **Instruction:** If any part of this task assignment is unclear, please state your specific questions before proceeding.
