# APM Task Assignment: Canvas Boundary and Grid Toggles

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

You are activated as an Implementation Agent within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the GramFrame project. Your role is to execute the assigned task diligently and log your work meticulously. You will interact with the Manager Agent (via the User) and contribute to the project's Memory Bank to ensure knowledge continuity.

## 2. Onboarding / Context from Prior Work

The GramFrame project has completed Task 5.1, which implemented auto-detection and replacement of config tables with interactive GramFrame components. The component now automatically transforms HTML tables with the class "spectro-config" into fully functional analysis tools.

Your task builds on this foundation by adding canvas boundary and grid toggle options to the diagnostics page, enhancing the development and debugging experience.

## 3. Task Assignment

**Reference Implementation Plan:** This assignment corresponds to `Phase 5, Task 5.2: Add canvas boundary and grid toggles to diagnostics page` in the Implementation Plan.

**Objective:** Implement toggle controls for displaying canvas boundaries and grid overlays on the spectrogram, providing visual aids for development, debugging, and precise measurements.

**Detailed Action Steps:**

1. **Design and implement toggle controls:**
   - Create toggle switches or checkbox controls for boundary and grid display
   - Position the controls in an accessible location on the diagnostics page
   - Style the controls to match the existing UI aesthetic
   - Implement state management for the toggle settings
   - Ensure toggle states persist across page reloads if appropriate

2. **Implement canvas boundary visualization:**
   - Create SVG elements to represent the canvas boundaries
   - Style the boundary elements for clear visibility (e.g., dashed lines)
   - Ensure boundaries update when the component is resized
   - Add optional labels for canvas dimensions
   - Make boundaries only visible when the toggle is active

3. **Implement grid overlay:**
   - Create SVG elements for grid lines at regular intervals
   - Implement options for grid density or spacing
   - Add labels for grid coordinates (time and frequency values)
   - Style grid lines and labels for optimal visibility
   - Ensure the grid scales appropriately with the spectrogram
   - Make the grid only visible when the toggle is active

4. **Add configuration options:**
   - Implement controls for customizing grid spacing
   - Add options for grid line color and style
   - Create controls for boundary line appearance
   - Ensure all configuration options update in real-time
   - Store configuration in the component state

5. **Update state management:**
   - Extend the state to include boundary and grid visibility flags
   - Add grid configuration properties to the state
   - Update the state listener to include these new properties
   - Ensure proper state updates when toggles are activated

6. **Optimize rendering performance:**
   - Implement efficient rendering for grid lines
   - Use appropriate SVG techniques for large numbers of elements
   - Consider using canvas for complex grid patterns if necessary
   - Ensure smooth performance even with dense grids

7. **Create integration tests:**
   - Implement Playwright tests to verify boundary and grid functionality
   - Test that toggles correctly show/hide boundaries and grids
   - Verify that grid spacing and styling options work as expected
   - Test performance with various grid densities
   - Ensure boundaries and grids update correctly with component resizing

## 4. Expected Output & Deliverables

**Success Criteria:**
- Functional toggle controls for canvas boundaries and grid display
- Clear visualization of canvas boundaries when enabled
- Customizable grid overlay with labels
- Configuration options for grid spacing and appearance
- Smooth performance even with dense grids
- Proper state management for toggle settings
- All integration tests pass

**Deliverables:**
- Toggle control implementation
- Canvas boundary visualization
- Grid overlay implementation
- Configuration options for customization
- Updated state management
- Performance optimizations
- Integration tests for boundary and grid functionality

## 5. Memory Bank Logging Instructions

Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's `Memory_Bank.md` file. Adhere strictly to the established logging format. Ensure your log includes:
- A reference to the assigned task in the Implementation Plan
- A clear description of the boundary and grid toggle implementation
- Code snippets showing the visualization and configuration options
- Any challenges encountered and how they were resolved
- Confirmation of successful execution through passing tests

## 6. Clarification Instruction

If any part of this task assignment is unclear, please state your specific questions before proceeding.
