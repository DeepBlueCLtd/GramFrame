# APM Task Assignment: Mouse Tracking Implementation

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

You are activated as an Implementation Agent within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the GramFrame project. Your role is to execute the assigned task diligently and log your work meticulously. You will interact with the Manager Agent (via the User) and contribute to the project's Memory Bank to ensure knowledge continuity.

## 2. Onboarding / Context from Prior Work

The GramFrame project has successfully completed the SVG container implementation (Task 3.1), which provides:
- An SVG container as the primary element for the spectrogram display
- The spectrogram image embedded within the SVG using an image element
- Proper scaling and positioning within the SVG coordinate space
- Coordinate system transformation support between screen, SVG, and data coordinates
- Responsive behavior using ResizeObserver

Your task builds directly on this foundation by implementing mouse tracking functionality that will enable users to interact with the spectrogram.

## 3. Task Assignment

**Reference Implementation Plan:** This assignment corresponds to `Phase 3, Task 2: Mouse Tracking` in the Implementation Plan.

**Objective:** Implement mouse tracking functionality that converts screen coordinates to data space and updates the component state with the current mouse position.

**Detailed Action Steps:**

1. **Add event listeners for mouse movement:**
   - Attach mouse event listeners (mousemove) to the SVG container
   - Implement proper event handling that captures mouse coordinates
   - Ensure event listeners are properly cleaned up when the component is destroyed
   - Use TypeScript for type safety in event handling

2. **Implement coordinate conversion from screen to data space:**
   - Utilize the coordinate transformation functions created in Task 3.1
   - Convert mouse screen coordinates (clientX, clientY) to SVG coordinates
   - Transform SVG coordinates to data space (time and frequency values)
   - Handle edge cases where the mouse is outside the valid data range

3. **Update state with current mouse position:**
   - Extend the component state to include current mouse position in data coordinates
   - Update the state when mouse movement is detected
   - Implement debouncing for performance optimization if necessary
   - Ensure state updates trigger appropriate re-renders

4. **Write integration tests:**
   - Create Playwright tests that simulate mouse movement over the spectrogram
   - Verify that coordinate conversions are accurate at different positions
   - Test that state updates correctly reflect mouse position
   - Ensure edge cases (mouse outside bounds, rapid movement) are handled properly
   - Fix any broken integration tests before proceeding to the next task

## 4. Expected Output & Deliverables

**Success Criteria:**
- Mouse movement over the spectrogram is accurately tracked
- Screen coordinates are correctly converted to data space (time and frequency)
- Component state is updated with the current mouse position
- Edge cases are properly handled
- All integration tests pass

**Deliverables:**
- Mouse event handling implementation
- Coordinate conversion functionality
- State updates for mouse position
- Integration tests for mouse tracking

## 5. Memory Bank Logging Instructions

Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's `Memory_Bank.md` file. Adhere strictly to the established logging format. Ensure your log includes:
- A reference to the assigned task in the Implementation Plan
- A clear description of the mouse tracking implementation
- Code snippets showing the event handling and coordinate conversion
- Any challenges encountered with mouse tracking and how they were resolved
- Confirmation of successful execution through passing tests

## 6. Clarification Instruction

If any part of this task assignment is unclear, please state your specific questions before proceeding.
