# APM Task Assignment: Change `Rate` box label to `Ratio`

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

You are activated as an Implementation Agent within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the GramFrame project. Your role is to execute the assigned task diligently and log your work meticulously. You will interact with the Manager Agent (via the User) and contribute your work details to the Memory Bank for project continuity.

## 2. Task Assignment

**Reference GitHub Issue:** This assignment corresponds to GitHub Issue #62: "Change `Rate` box label to `Ratio`"

**Objective:** Update the user interface label from "Rate" to "Ratio" in the Harmonics Table to better reflect the actual functionality.

**Detailed Action Steps:**

1. **Identify UI Components with "Rate" Labels:**
   - Locate the Harmonics Table component in `src/components/HarmonicPanel.js:22` where the "Rate" column header appears
   - Identify any other UI components that display "Rate" labels related to the harmonics functionality

2. **Update Label Text:**
   - Change the column header text from "Rate" to "Ratio" in the harmonics table
   - Ensure consistency across all related UI elements that reference this concept

3. **Verify No Functional Impact:**
   - Confirm that only display labels are being changed, not the underlying functionality
   - Ensure that variable names, function parameters, and internal logic remain unchanged unless they specifically relate to user-facing display text

4. **Test the Changes:**
   - Run the development server with `yarn dev`
   - Verify that the Harmonics mode displays "Ratio" instead of "Rate" in the table headers
   - Ensure all harmonics calculations and functionality work correctly

**Provide Necessary Context/Assets:**

- **Primary File:** `src/components/HarmonicPanel.js` - Contains the harmonics table UI component
- **Key Lines:** Line 22 and 93 contain `<th>Rate</th>` elements that need to be updated
- **Architecture Context:** This is a pure UI label change that should not affect the underlying harmonics calculation logic
- **Testing:** Use the sample HTML files in the `sample/` directory or `debug.html` for testing

## 3. Expected Output & Deliverables

**Define Success:** 
- The Harmonics Table displays "Ratio" instead of "Rate" in column headers
- All harmonics functionality continues to work correctly
- No regression in existing features

**Specify Deliverables:**
- Modified `src/components/HarmonicPanel.js` file with updated labels
- Confirmation that the application runs without errors
- Visual verification that the label change is properly displayed

## 4. Memory Bank Logging Instructions

Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's [Memory_Bank.md](../../Memory_Bank.md) file.

Adhere strictly to the established logging format. Ensure your log includes:
- A reference to GitHub Issue #62
- A clear description of the label changes made
- The specific files modified and lines changed
- Confirmation of successful testing and no functional regressions
- Any observations about the UI consistency or user experience improvements

## 5. Clarification Instruction

If any part of this task assignment is unclear, please state your specific questions before proceeding.
