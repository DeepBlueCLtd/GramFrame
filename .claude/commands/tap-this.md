# Create Task Assignment Prompt

## Task Assignment Prompt Creation
Read the guide at prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/03_Task_Assignment_Prompts_Guide.md and use it to create a task assignment prompt for GitHub issue #{issue_number} from the upstream repository for this project. 

Analyze the GitHub issue to understand the requirements, scope, and technical details. Then generate a structured task assignment prompt following the guide's template and save it to prompts/tasks/Task_Issue_{issue_number}.md.

The prompt should be ready for a Manager Agent to assign to an Implementation Agent within the APM framework.

## Completion
Once the task assignment prompt is created and saved, send a notification with the prompt location and brief summary of the GitHub issue for tracking purposes.
