# Create Task Assignment Prompt

Interview me to determine what the task is.  The interview should include the type of task, and what success looks like. I favour multiple choice questions, asked one at a time.

Read the guide at prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/03_Task_Assignment_Prompts_Guide.md and use it to create a task assignment prompt for identified task. 

Generate a structured task assignment prompt following the guide's template and save it to prompts/tasks/Task_{task_name}.md.

The prompt should be ready for a Manager Agent to assign to an Implementation Agent within the APM framework.
