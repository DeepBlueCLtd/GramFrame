# GramFrame Walkthrough Script (User-Facing)

An interactive walkthrough for end users of the GramFrame spectrogram analysis component.

## ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Welcome

**Welcome to GramFrame!**  
This tool helps you analyse sonar spectrograms â€” just like at the console, but directly in your browser.  
Letâ€™s walk through its features.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Spectrogram Area

ðŸŽ¯ **Target:** The spectrogram image

**This is your spectrogram.**  
Move your mouse across it to see the precise time and frequency under the cursor â€” displayed below in a digital-style readout.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Analysis Mode

ðŸŽ¯ **Target:** "Analysis" mode toggle (and empty plot)

**Analysis Mode** shows the exact frequency at any point on the spectrogram.  
- **Click** to place a cursor  
- **Drag** to move it and explore different frequencies  
Use this mode to mark points of interest and compare tonal elements.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Harmonics Mode

ðŸŽ¯ **Target:** "Harmonics" mode toggle (and active cursor)

**Harmonics Mode** builds on Analysis.  
It shows harmonic lines at 2Ã—, 3Ã—, etc. above your base frequency.  
These help identify sources like rotating machinery, where harmonic structure reveals the type of emitter.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Rate Input

ðŸŽ¯ **Target:** The "Rate" input box

You can enter a **rate** here (e.g., 12.5 Hz for shaft or cylinder rate).  
Harmonic frequencies will be divided by this value â€” useful for matching measured tones to known machinery rates.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Doppler Mode

ðŸŽ¯ **Target:** "Doppler" mode toggle

**Doppler Mode** (if enabled) helps you visualise frequency shifts over time.  
Use it to estimate approach angles, closing speeds, or confirm contacts exhibiting classical Doppler curves.
