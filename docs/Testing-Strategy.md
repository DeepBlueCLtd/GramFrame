# GramFrame Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the GramFrame project, including the role of the Testing Agent, testing methodologies, and integration with the development workflow.

## Testing Agent Role

The Testing Agent is a dedicated role within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework responsible for ensuring the quality and reliability of the GramFrame component through comprehensive testing.

### Responsibilities

1. **Test Specification Creation**
   - Create detailed test specifications before implementation begins
   - Define expected behaviors, inputs, and outputs for each feature
   - Identify edge cases and potential failure scenarios
   - Document test specifications using the [Testing_Template.md](Testing_Template.md) format

2. **Test Implementation**
   - Develop unit tests for individual functions and components
   - Create integration tests for feature interactions
   - Implement Playwright tests for UI and end-to-end testing
   - Ensure tests follow best practices and are maintainable

3. **Verification and Validation**
   - Verify that implemented features meet all test criteria
   - Validate that features fulfill their intended purpose
   - Document test results in the Memory Bank
   - Approve task completion only when all tests pass

4. **Continuous Testing Support**
   - Maintain and update test suites as requirements evolve
   - Ensure regression tests are in place for bug fixes
   - Monitor test coverage and identify gaps
   - Provide testing expertise throughout the project lifecycle

### Workflow Integration

The Testing Agent works in parallel with the Implementation Agent following this workflow:

1. **Pre-Implementation Phase**
   - Testing Agent reviews task requirements
   - Creates test specifications
   - Documents these in the Memory Bank
   - Shares test specifications with the Implementation Agent

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Implementation Agent develops the feature
   - Testing Agent refines tests as needed
   - Regular communication ensures alignment

3. **Verification Phase**
   - Testing Agent runs tests against the implemented feature
   - Documents results in the Memory Bank
   - Identifies any issues or gaps
   - Works with Implementation Agent to resolve issues

4. **Approval Phase**
   - Testing Agent approves task completion when all tests pass
   - Updates task status in the Implementation Plan
   - Ensures test documentation is complete

## Testing Methodologies

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

The GramFrame project follows a test-driven development approach:

1. Write tests that define expected behavior
2. Run tests to confirm they fail (as the feature doesn't exist yet)
3. Implement the feature
4. Run tests to verify the implementation
5. Refactor code while ensuring tests continue to pass

### Testing Levels

#### Unit Testing

- Tests individual functions and components in isolation
- Focuses on specific behaviors and edge cases
- Typically involves mocking dependencies

#### Integration Testing

- Tests interactions between components
- Ensures different parts of the system work together
- Identifies interface issues

#### End-to-End Testing

- Tests the complete user flow
- Uses Playwright to simulate real user interactions
- Verifies the system works as a whole

### Test Coverage Requirements

- All functions must have unit tests
- All user interactions must have integration tests
- All critical paths must have end-to-end tests
- Edge cases must be identified and tested
- Test coverage should be at least 80% for all code

## Test Documentation

All testing activities must be documented in the Memory Bank following the [Testing_Template.md](Testing_Template.md) format. Documentation should include:

- Test specifications
- Test implementation details
- Test results
- Issues found and resolutions
- Follow-up actions

## Tools and Technologies

- **Unit Testing**: Jest
- **End-to-End Testing**: Playwright
- **Coverage Reporting**: Jest Coverage
- **Documentation**: Markdown in Memory Bank

## Success Criteria

Testing is considered successful when:

1. All specified tests pass
2. Code coverage meets or exceeds requirements
3. Edge cases are properly handled
4. Documentation is complete and accurate
5. The feature works as expected in all supported environments

## Continuous Improvement

The testing strategy should evolve throughout the project lifecycle. The Testing Agent should:

1. Regularly review testing practices
2. Identify opportunities for improvement
3. Update testing documentation as needed
4. Share lessons learned with the team
