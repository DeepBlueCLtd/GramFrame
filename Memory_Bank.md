# GramFrame Project Memory Bank

## Project Overview
GramFrame is a component for displaying and interacting with spectrograms. It provides a canvas-based display with time and frequency indicators, LED-style readouts, and interactive features for exploring spectrogram data.

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Bootstrapping + Dev Harness (Completed)
**Date: July 18, 2025**

#### Task 1.1: Create `debug.html` page that loads a fixed component instance

#### Task 1.2: Hook up "Hello World" from component inside the debug page
- Added Hello World message to component (later removed when no longer needed)
- Created styling for the message
- Verified component rendering in the debug page

#### Task 1.3: Set up hot module reload and visible console logging for state
- Implemented HMR using Vite's `import.meta.hot` API

#### Task 2.8: Comprehensive Phase 2 Testing
- Created complete Phase 2 test suite in `tests/phase2.spec.ts`
- Implemented 9 comprehensive tests covering all Phase 2 functionality
- All tests pass successfully, verifying integration of all components

#### Integration Test Fix
- Fixed failing state listener error handling test
- Updated `forceUpdate()` method to properly trigger state notifications
- Modified test to capture console errors instead of window errors
- All 18 tests now pass successfully

## Completed Tasks Summary
**Date: July 18, 2025**

### Phase 1: Bootstrapping + Dev Harness ✅
- Debug page implementation
- Component initialization and rendering
- Hot module reload and console logging
- Comprehensive Playwright test suite (3 tests)

### Phase 2: Basic Layout and Diagnostics Panel ✅  
- Image loading from config
- Min/max time/frequency extraction and display
- LED-style readout panel
- Diagnostics panel with real-time updates
- State listener mechanism with error handling
- Comprehensive Playwright test suite (9 tests)

### Phase 3: SVG Container and Axes Implementation ✅
**Date: July 18, 2025**

#### Task 3.1: SVG Container Implementation with Axes
- Successfully migrated from HTML5 Canvas to SVG container
- Implemented proper SVG namespace handling (`setAttribute` instead of `className`)
- Created coordinate transformation system:
  - `_screenToSVGCoordinates()` - screen pixels to SVG coordinates
  - `_svgToDataCoordinates()` - SVG coordinates to data space (time/frequency)
  - `_imageToDataCoordinates()` - image-relative coordinates to data space
  - `_dataToSVGCoordinates()` - data coordinates to SVG space
  - `_svgToScreenCoordinates()` - SVG coordinates back to screen pixels
- Added ResizeObserver for responsive behavior
- Implemented axes with tick marks and labels:
  - **Time axis (vertical)** on the left side with time values in seconds
  - **Frequency axis (horizontal)** on the bottom with frequency values in Hz
  - Dynamic tick density that adjusts based on available space
  - Proper margin allocation (50px left, 30px bottom, 10px right/top)
- Updated mouse handling to account for axes margins
- Enhanced state structure with axes configuration and image-relative coordinates
- Updated CSS styles for SVG elements and axes styling
- Comprehensive test coverage (23/24 tests passing)
- Fixed axis orientation confusion (frequency=horizontal, time=vertical)

**Agent:** Implementation Agent
**Task Reference:** Phase 3, Task 3.2: Mouse Tracking Implementation

**Summary:**
Enhanced and completed mouse tracking functionality with comprehensive edge case handling, proper event listener cleanup, and extensive test coverage.

**Details:**
- Enhanced existing mouse tracking implementation that was already functional but lacked comprehensive edge case handling and cleanup
- Added proper event listener cleanup with bound references for component destruction
- Implemented mouse leave handling to clear cursor position when mouse exits SVG container
- Enhanced edge case handling to clear cursor position when mouse moves outside image bounds (into margin areas)
- Improved LED display updates to show default values ("0.00 Hz", "0.00 s") when cursor position is null
- Added comprehensive component destruction method with proper resource cleanup
- Created 5 new integration tests specifically for mouse tracking functionality:
  - Mouse movement accuracy across multiple positions within the image
  - Mouse leave behavior and cursor position clearing
  - Edge case handling when mouse is outside image bounds but within SVG
  - Coordinate conversion accuracy testing at image corners and center
  - LED display integration with mouse tracking state changes
- Fixed existing test that was affected by enhanced edge case handling
- Maintained all existing coordinate transformation functionality

**Output/Result:**
```javascript
// Enhanced event listener setup with proper cleanup references
_setupEventListeners() {
  // Bind event handlers to maintain proper 'this' context
  this._boundHandleMouseMove = this._handleMouseMove.bind(this)
  this._boundHandleMouseLeave = this._handleMouseLeave.bind(this)
  this._boundHandleClick = this._handleClick.bind(this)
  this._boundHandleResize = this._handleResize.bind(this)
  
  // SVG mouse events
  this.svg.addEventListener('mousemove', this._boundHandleMouseMove)
  this.svg.addEventListener('mouseleave', this._boundHandleMouseLeave)
  this.svg.addEventListener('click', this._boundHandleClick)
  // ... other event listeners
}

// New mouse leave handler
_handleMouseLeave(event) {
  // Clear cursor position when mouse leaves the SVG area
  this.state.cursorPosition = null
  this._updateLEDDisplays()
  this._notifyStateListeners()
}

// Enhanced edge case handling in mouse move
// Only process if mouse is within the image area
if (imageRelativeX < 0 || imageRelativeY < 0 || 
    imageRelativeX > this.state.imageDetails.naturalWidth || 
    imageRelativeY > this.state.imageDetails.naturalHeight) {
  // Clear cursor position when mouse is outside image bounds
  this.state.cursorPosition = null
  this._updateLEDDisplays()
  this._notifyStateListeners()
  return
}

// Component cleanup method
destroy() {
  this._cleanupEventListeners()
  if (this.container && this.container.parentNode) {
    this.container.parentNode.removeChild(this.container)
  }
}
```

Created comprehensive test file: `tests/mouse-tracking.spec.ts` with 5 test cases covering all mouse tracking scenarios.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None. One existing test required adjustment due to enhanced edge case handling where mouse position is properly cleared when outside image bounds.

**Next Steps:**
Ready to proceed with Task 3.3: Time/Frequency Cursor Display implementation.
