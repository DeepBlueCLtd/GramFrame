# GramFrame Project Memory Bank

## Project Overview
GramFrame is a component for displaying and interacting with spectrograms. It provides an SVG-based display with time and frequency indicators, LED-style readouts, and interactive features for exploring spectrogram data.

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Bootstrapping + Dev Harness (Completed)
**Date: July 18, 2025**

Created debug.html page with component initialization and responsive layout. Implemented HMR using Vite with state preservation and console logging for debugging.

### Phase 2: Basic Layout and Diagnostics Panel (Partially Completed)
**Date: July 18, 2025**

Implemented spectrogram image loading, coordinate extraction from config table, and LED display components. Created responsive resizing and proper axis orientation (frequency horizontal, time vertical).

### Phase 5: Auto-Detection and Config Tables (Completed)
**Date: July 20, 2025**

#### Task 5.1: Auto-Detect and Replace Config Tables Implementation

Implemented comprehensive auto-detection that scans DOM for "gram-config" tables and replaces them with GramFrame components. Features include:
- Multiple table support with unique instance IDs
- Robust configuration extraction with validation and graceful defaults
- Seamless table replacement maintaining layout context
- Public API methods: `initializeTable()`, `getInstances()`, `getInstance()`
- Comprehensive error handling with visual indicators
- Created 7 passing Playwright tests covering all functionality

### Task 2.6: E2E Tests for Doppler Mode Feature (Completed)
**Date: July 23, 2025**

Implemented comprehensive E2E tests for Doppler Mode using Playwright (715 lines):
- Mode activation and UI visibility tests
- Marker placement/dragging functionality
- S-curve rendering and real-time updates
- Speed calculation accuracy validation
- Reset and mode switching behavior
- Boundary constraints and UX testing
- Accessibility and responsiveness validation
- 24 tests covering all user workflows

Technical challenges resolved: SVG element visibility, speed LED initial values, marker placement patterns.

### Phase 2-3: Core Implementation (Completed)
**Date: July 18, 2025**

Completed Phase 2 with image loading, LED panels, diagnostics, and state listeners (9 tests). Implemented Phase 3 SVG container with axes, coordinate transformations, ResizeObserver, and comprehensive mouse tracking (5 tests).

### Phase 4: Mode System Implementation
**Date: July 18-30, 2025**

#### Mode Switching UI (Task 4.1)
Created mode switching UI with state management, LED integration, and 9 comprehensive tests.

#### Analysis Mode (Task 4.2)
Implemented mode-specific cross-hairs, enhanced LED formatting ("Freq: X.X Hz"), hover-only interaction, 9 tests.

#### Harmonics Mode (Task 4.3)
Initially hover-based, updated to Analysis mode drag integration. Features drag-based harmonics, real-time calculation, distinct styling, 5 core tests.

#### Rate Input (Task 4.6)
Added rate input with validation, LED display, harmonic integration, 13 tests covering all functionality.

## Technical Decisions
**Date: July 18, 2025**

- Centralized state with listener pattern
- Flexbox responsive layout
- Event handling with coordinate bounds checking

### Task 1.1: JSDoc Retrofit for Type Safety
**Date: July 2025**

Successfully implemented JSDoc type safety without transpilation:
- Created tsconfig.json with checkJs mode
- Added 20+ type definitions in src/types.js
- 60+ JSDoc annotations in src/main.js
- Reduced TypeScript errors from 100+ to ~50
- Enhanced IDE support and documentation

### Task 1.1: Mode Architecture Refactor - Phase 1
**Date: July 2025**

Created base infrastructure for polymorphic mode system:
- BaseMode interface with lifecycle/event/rendering methods
- ModeFactory with error handling and validation
- Main class infrastructure with mode instances
- No behavioral changes, all tests pass

### GitHub Issue #32: Refactor Configuration Table Structure to Legacy Format (Completed)
**Date: July 29, 2025**

Refactored configuration table to support legacy row-based format with improved parsing:
- Row-based structure: parameter | min | max
- Flexible parameter name handling with aliases
- Enhanced validation and error messages
- 100% backward compatibility maintained

### GitHub Issue #44: Fix Axis Text Labels Resize Issue (Completed)
**Date: July 29, 2025**

Fixed axis labels not resizing properly:
- SVG text elements now use viewBox scaling
- Dynamic font sizes based on container dimensions
- Proper tick density adjustments
- Enhanced label visibility at all zoom levels

### Phase 6: Zoom Infrastructure Cleanup (Completed)
**Date: July 30, 2025**

Major code reorganization improving maintainability:
- Created 12 modular components from monolithic main.js
- Extracted rendering, UI, event handling, and utilities
- Reduced main.js from 1,606 to 816 lines
- All 8 tests continue passing

### Task 7.1: Spectrogram SVG Component Reinstatement (Completed)
**Date: July 30, 2025**

Reinstated spectrogram image as SVG <image> element:
- Fixed SVG rendering with proper namespace and preserveAspectRatio
- Maintained coordinate system accuracy
- Restored visual spectrogram display
- All existing functionality preserved

### Task 4.3: Harmonics Mode Implementation (Completed)
**Date: July 30, 2025**

Successfully implemented complete Harmonics mode functionality with:

**Core Features:**
- Click-to-create harmonic sets with intelligent initial spacing
- Dual-axis drag for spacing (horizontal) and time (vertical) adjustment
- Visual rendering with 20% height constraint and color distinction
- Management panel with real-time rate calculations
- Manual harmonic modal with validation

**Technical Implementation:**
- Extends BaseMode with proper mode system integration
- State management with harmonicSets array and dragState tracking
- FeatureRenderer integration for cross-mode visibility
- Comprehensive error handling and constraint enforcement

**Post-Implementation Refinements:**
- Changed to click-and-drag creation pattern
- Fixed CSS for solid line rendering

### Task 4.9: Unified Readout Layout Implementation (Completed)
**Date: July 30, 2025**

Implemented unified 3-column layout addressing GitHub issue #64:

**Layout Architecture:**
- Left Column (30%): Universal controls (LEDs, color picker)
- Middle Column (35%): Analysis Markers (always visible)
- Right Column (35%): Harmonics sets (always visible)

**Key Features:**
- Universal cursor readouts work across all modes
- Persistent containers survive mode switches
- Central LED management for consistency
- Responsive design with mobile support
- Smooth mode switching without UI recreation

**Technical Changes:**
- Refactored all mode UI creation to use persistent containers
- Centralized color picker and LED components
- Modified mode switching to preserve layout structure
