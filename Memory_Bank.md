## Issue #130 - Fix Manual Harmonics Visibility When Zoomed - 2025-01-08

**Task Reference:** GitHub Issue #130 and Task Assignment Prompt Task_Issue_130.md
**Problem:** Manual harmonics were placed at the center of the overall time period instead of the center of the currently visible (zoomed) time period, making them invisible to users when zoomed in.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- In `ManualHarmonicModal.js` (lines 88-89), when no cursor position was available, anchor time was calculated using `(state.config.timeMin + state.config.timeMax) / 2` 
- This used the **full time range** rather than the **visible time range** when zoomed
- Users had to zoom out to see newly created manual harmonics, degrading user experience

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Exported existing infrastructure:** Modified `calculateVisibleDataRange()` function in `src/components/table.js` from private to exported function to enable reuse
2. **Enhanced modal interface:** Updated `showManualHarmonicModal()` signature to accept GramFrame instance parameter for access to zoom state
3. **Created helper function:** Added `calculateVisibleTimePeriodCenter(state, instance)` in `ManualHarmonicModal.js` that:
   - Returns full time range center when zoom level = 1.0 (backward compatibility)
   - Calculates visible time range center using `calculateVisibleDataRange()` when zoomed
4. **Updated anchor calculation:** Modified `addHarmonic()` function to use zoom-aware center calculation when no cursor position available

**Key Code Changes:**
- `src/components/table.js`: Exported `calculateVisibleDataRange()` function
- `src/modes/harmonics/HarmonicsMode.js`: Updated modal call to pass instance parameter
- `src/modes/harmonics/ManualHarmonicModal.js`: 
  - Added import for `calculateVisibleDataRange`
  - Added `calculateVisibleTimePeriodCenter()` helper function  
  - Updated modal signature and anchor time calculation logic

**Testing and Verification:**
- All harmonics mode tests pass (10/10 tests successful)
- TypeScript compilation successful with no errors
- Build process successful with no issues
- No regression in existing functionality confirmed

**Technical Decisions:**
- Leveraged existing `calculateVisibleDataRange()` infrastructure rather than duplicating zoom logic
- Maintained backward compatibility by preserving behavior when zoom level = 1.0
- Used dependency injection pattern to pass GramFrame instance to modal for clean separation of concerns

**Result:** Manual harmonics are now positioned at the center of the visible viewport when zoomed, immediately visible to users without requiring zoom out operation.

## Issue #88 Phase A-B - Refactor Large Files and Improve Module Boundaries - 2025-01-06

**Task Reference:** GitHub Issue #88 - Refactor Large Files and Improve Module Boundaries
**Phase:** A-B (Coordinate Transformation Utilities + High-Complexity Function Refactoring)
**Complexity Metrics:** 
- HarmonicsMode.renderHarmonicSet: CC 12→2
- DopplerMode.handleMouseMove: CC 21→8  
- table.js:renderFrequencyAxis: CC 32→9
- Code duplication: 1.42%→1.51% (within target <2%)

**Actions Taken:**
**Phase A - Coordinate Transformation Utilities:**
1. **Created reusable coordinate utilities** in `src/utils/coordinateTransformations.js`:
   - `dataToSVG(dataPoint, viewport, spectrogramImage)` - Universal coordinate transformation with zoom awareness

   - Main function now orchestrates sub-functions with clean separation of concerns

4. **DopplerMode.handleMouseMove refactoring (CC: 21→8):**
   - `detectClosestMarker(mousePos, doppler)` - Marker proximity detection
   - `handlePreviewDrag(dataCoords, doppler)` - Preview drag handling
   - `handleMarkerDrag(dataCoords, doppler)` - Marker dragging logic  
   - `updateCursorStyle(event, doppler)` - Cursor styling
   - Eliminated duplicate marker detection code across mouse events

5. **table.js:renderFrequencyAxis refactoring (CC: 32→9, 150→75 lines):**
   - `calculateAxisTicks(min, max, containerSize, targetSpacing)` - "Nice numbers" algorithm
   - `formatFrequencyLabels(frequency)` - Label formatting utility

**Agent:** Implementation Agent  
**Task Reference:** GitHub Issue #101 (SVG Feature Clipping Implementation)

**Summary:**
Successfully implemented dual clipping path system to prevent SVG mode-specific features from rendering outside graph area boundaries. All cursor group features (Analysis markers, Harmonics curves, Doppler indicators) are now visually contained within the defined margin boundaries (left: 60px, bottom: 50px, right: 15px, top: 15px).

**Details:**
- **Dual Clipping Infrastructure:** Extended existing SVG clipping system in `src/components/table.js:55-70` to include a second clipPath for cursor group features alongside the existing image clipping
- **Cursor Group Clipping:** Created `cursorClipRect` with unique ID (`cursorClip-${instanceId}`) and applied to `cursorGroup` element using identical `clip-path` attribute pattern
- **Synchronized Updates:** Extended `updateSVGLayout` function (lines 193-198) to maintain identical dimensions between both clipping rectangles, ensuring consistent boundary enforcement
- **Type System Updates:** Added `cursorClipRect` property to both `TableElements` typedef and `GramFrameInstance` class with proper JSDoc annotations

**Key Architecture Changes:**
- SVG structure now maintains two synchronized clipping paths: one for spectrogram image, one for all interactive features
- Clipping rectangles dynamically update with zoom/pan operations through existing `updateSVGLayout` mechanism  
- All mode-specific rendering (cursors.js, FeatureRenderer.js) automatically respects boundaries without requiring individual modifications
- Visual integrity preserved across all modes without affecting feature functionality or cross-mode persistence

**Code Impact:**
- Modified: `src/components/table.js` (added dual clipping path creation and synchronized updates)
- Modified: `src/types.js` (added cursorClipRect to TableElements typedef)  
- Modified: `src/main.js` (added cursorClipRect property initialization)
- Testing: Confirmed visual containment across Analysis, Harmonics, Doppler, and Pan modes with zoom/pan operations

**Technical Implementation:**
```javascript
// Dual clipping path creation (table.js:63-70)
const cursorClipPathId = `cursorClip-${instance.instanceId || Date.now()}`
const cursorClipPath = document.createElementNS('http://www.w3.org/2000/svg', 'clipPath')
cursorClipPath.setAttribute('id', cursorClipPathId)
instance.cursorGroup.setAttribute('clip-path', `url(#${cursorClipPathId})`)

// Synchronized dimension updates (table.js:193-198)
if (instance.cursorClipRect) {
  instance.cursorClipRect.setAttribute('x', String(margins.left))
  instance.cursorClipRect.setAttribute('y', String(margins.top))
  instance.cursorClipRect.setAttribute('width', String(axesWidth))
  instance.cursorClipRect.setAttribute('height', String(axesHeight))
}
```

**Task Reference:** GitHub Issue #85 (Decompose main.js Monolithic File)

**Summary:**
Successfully decomposed the monolithic `src/main.js` file from 695 lines to 492 lines (203-line reduction) by extracting UI creation and viewport management into separate modules while preserving all functionality and maintaining backward compatibility.

**Details:**
- **Extracted MainUI Module:** Created `src/components/MainUI.js` (224 lines) containing UI layout creation functions including `createUnifiedLayout()`, `updateUniversalCursorReadouts()`, and `updatePersistentPanels()`. This module handles the complete 3-column layout system with mode buttons, guidance panels, LED displays, and container management.
- **Extracted Viewport Module:** Created `src/core/viewport.js` (107 lines) containing all zoom/pan functionality including `zoomIn()`, `zoomOut()`, `zoomReset()`, `setZoom()`, `handleResize()`, and `updateAxes()`. This module manages viewport state transformations and control button state updates.
- **Enhanced Events Integration:** Updated `src/core/events.js` to import and use the new MainUI functions, maintaining the existing event delegation pattern while using the extracted modules.
- **Preserved Public API:** All public GramFrame class methods remain unchanged, ensuring no breaking changes for external consumers. The refactored methods now delegate to the appropriate extracted modules.
- **Maintained Architecture Patterns:** Both new modules follow established codebase patterns with proper JSDoc documentation, consistent import/export conventions, and integration with the existing state management system.

**Output/Result:**
```javascript
// New MainUI module structure (src/components/MainUI.js)
export function createUnifiedLayout(instance) { /* 3-column layout creation */ }
export function updateUniversalCursorReadouts(instance, dataCoords) { /* LED updates */ }
export function updatePersistentPanels(instance) { /* markers/harmonics panels */ }

// New Viewport module structure (src/core/viewport.js) 
export function zoomIn(instance) { /* zoom level increase */ }
export function setZoom(instance, level, centerX, centerY) { /* zoom state management */ }
export function handleResize(instance) { /* responsive layout updates */ }

// Updated main.js delegation pattern
_zoomIn() { zoomIn(this) }
_handleResize() { handleResize(this) }
```

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
Minor TypeScript definition issues with new column properties (`modeColumn`, `guidanceColumn`, `controlsColumn`) not recognized in type definitions, but functionality works correctly. All 59 Playwright tests pass successfully.

**Next Steps:**
Ready for additional decomposition phases if needed. The current 492-line main.js focuses primarily on orchestration and mode switching logic, with UI creation and viewport management successfully extracted to dedicated modules.

**Task Reference:** GitHub Issue #100 (Implement Pan as a Mode Extending BaseMode)

**Summary:**
Successfully transformed pan functionality from a toggle overlay into a proper mode that extends BaseMode, resolving conflicts between pan mode and other drag operations. Pan is now the 4th interaction mode alongside Analysis, Harmonics, and Doppler, appearing as a dedicated button (↔) in the modes toolbar.

**Details:**
- **New PanMode Implementation:** Created `src/modes/pan/PanMode.js` extending BaseMode with complete lifecycle methods (activate, deactivate, handleMouseDown/Move/Up, handleMouseLeave)
- **Mode Registration:** Updated ModeFactory, types definitions, and ModeButtons to include 'pan' as the 4th available mode
- **Legacy Code Removal:** Eliminated pan-specific logic from events.js (146-171, 220-235, 256-264 lines) and main.js (_togglePan, _panImage methods)
- **Zoom Integration:** Added automatic pan mode disabling when zoom level ≤ 1.0, with graceful fallback to previous mode
- **State Management:** Added previousMode tracking and pan mode initial state, removed legacy panMode toggle flag
- **Testing Results:** All 59 existing tests pass, TypeScript compilation successful, no regressions detected

**Key Architecture Changes:**
- Pan mode conflicts resolved - users can now drag harmonics without pan mode interference  
- Pan functionality properly integrated into the modular mode system following ADR-008 patterns
- UI consistency maintained with pan button using same styling as other mode buttons
- Zoom-dependent mode switching ensures pan is only available when meaningful (zoom > 1:1)

**Code Impact:**
- Added: `src/modes/pan/PanMode.js` (200+ lines)  
- Modified: 6 files (ModeFactory.js, types.js, ModeButtons.js, events.js, main.js, state.js)
- Removed: ~80 lines of pan-specific legacy code
- CSS: Removed obsolete .gram-frame-pan-toggle.active styles

**Task Reference:** GitHub Issue #63 (Enhanced Frequency Axis with Denser Markers and Labels)

**Summary:**
Enhanced the frequency axis rendering to provide more granular frequency markers and labels, implementing intelligent 5Hz/2.5Hz interval spacing with visual hierarchy to improve spectrogram analysis usability.

**Details:**
- Analyzed current `renderFrequencyAxis` function in `src/components/table.js` (lines 389-434) that used fixed 5 evenly-spaced ticks
- Designed adaptive tick spacing algorithm that scales based on frequency range:
  * ≤50Hz range: 5Hz major, 2.5Hz minor intervals (as requested)
  * ≤100Hz range: 10Hz major, 5Hz minor intervals
  * ≤500Hz range: 25Hz major, 12.5Hz minor intervals  
  * >500Hz range: 50Hz major, 25Hz minor intervals
- Implemented intelligent positioning algorithm that aligns ticks to interval boundaries and prevents overlap
- Added fallback to original behavior for extremely dense cases (>maxTicks threshold)
- Created visual hierarchy with major ticks (8px height) with labels and minor ticks (4px height) without labels
- Made major tick labels slightly smaller (10px vs 12px) as requested in issue specification
- Preserved rate parameter scaling functionality (`displayFreq = freq / rate`)

**Output/Result:**
```javascript
// Key algorithm snippet from enhanced renderFrequencyAxis function
// Determine appropriate tick intervals based on frequency range
let majorInterval, minorInterval, maxTicks

if (freqRange <= 50) {
  // For small ranges, use 5Hz and 2.5Hz intervals as requested
  majorInterval = 5
  minorInterval = 2.5
  maxTicks = 200
} else if (freqRange <= 100) {
  // For medium ranges, use 10Hz and 5Hz intervals
  majorInterval = 10
  minorInterval = 5
  maxTicks = 100
}
// ... additional range handling
```

```css
/* New CSS classes added for visual hierarchy */
.gram-frame-axis-tick-major {
  stroke: #fff;
  stroke-width: 1;
}

.gram-frame-axis-tick-minor {
  stroke: #fff;
  stroke-width: 1;
}

.gram-frame-axis-label-major {
  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, sans-serif;
  font-size: 10px;  /* Slightly smaller as requested */
  fill: #fff;
  dominant-baseline: central;
}
```

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Ready for testing with various frequency ranges and potential fine-tuning based on user feedback. All tests passing (59/59) and development server running successfully.

**Task Reference:** GitHub Issue #63 Enhancement - Adaptive Tick Spacing Algorithm

**Summary:**
Enhanced the frequency axis algorithm to use Paul Heckbert's "nice numbers" approach, making it truly adaptive to zoom levels and capable of handling large frequency ranges (1000Hz+) as requested.

**Details:**
- Researched best practices for adaptive axis tick spacing algorithms
- Identified the core issue: fixed 5Hz intervals regardless of zoom level or frequency range
- Implemented Paul Heckbert's "nice numbers" algorithm from Graphics Gems
- Algorithm now considers pixel density (targets ~80px between major ticks) and uses "nice" intervals (1, 2, 5 × 10^n)
- Replaced hardcoded breakpoints with dynamic calculation based on available width and frequency range
- Added intelligent minor tick calculation (1/2 or 1/5 of major interval depending on base)
- Preserves rate parameter functionality and existing visual hierarchy

**Output/Result:**
```javascript
// Core nice numbers algorithm implementation
function niceNum(range, round) {
  const exponent = Math.floor(Math.log10(range))
  const fraction = range / Math.pow(10, exponent)
  let niceFraction
  
  if (round) {
    if (fraction < 1.5) niceFraction = 1
    else if (fraction < 3) niceFraction = 2
    else if (fraction < 7) niceFraction = 5
    else niceFraction = 10
  } else {
    if (fraction <= 1) niceFraction = 1
    else if (fraction <= 2) niceFraction = 2
    else if (fraction <= 5) niceFraction = 5
    else niceFraction = 10
  }
  
  return niceFraction * Math.pow(10, exponent)
}
```

**Algorithm Test Results:**
- 50Hz range → 10Hz major, 2Hz minor intervals
- 1000Hz range → 200Hz major, 100Hz minor intervals  
- 2000Hz range → 500Hz major, 100Hz minor intervals
- Maintains consistent ~160-200px visual spacing across all ranges
- Properly handles rate parameter scaling and different image widths

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Algorithm now scales from tight zoomed-in views (2Hz intervals) to wide range views (500Hz intervals) while maintaining optimal visual density and "nice" human-readable numbers.

**Task Reference:** GitHub Issue #106 (Feature: Ensure file:// protocol compatibility for standalone HTML deployment)

**Summary:**
Successfully implemented file:// protocol compatibility for GramFrame by creating a standalone IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) build that bundles all dependencies into a single JavaScript file with inlined CSS. This enables GramFrame to function perfectly when HTML files are opened directly from the file system without requiring a web server.

**Details:**
- **Dual Build System:** Enhanced vite.config.js to support both standard development builds and standalone builds via `BUILD_STANDALONE=true` environment variable
- **IIFE Bundle Format:** Configured Rollup to output IIFE format instead of ES modules, eliminating CORS issues with `<script type="module">` tags
- **CSS Inlining:** Implemented custom Rollup plugin that injects CSS content directly into JavaScript bundle and auto-applies styles via `document.head.appendChild(style)`
- **Relative Path Resolution:** Set `base: './'` to ensure all asset references use relative paths instead of absolute `/assets/` paths
- **Single File Output:** Created complete standalone bundle at `dist/gramframe.bundle.js` (185KB) with all dependencies and CSS included
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Created `test-file-protocol.html` with multiple GramFrame instances testing Analysis, Harmonics, and Doppler modes

**Key Architecture Changes:**
- Vite configuration now conditionally outputs either standard multi-file build or standalone IIFE bundle
- CSS injection occurs automatically at bundle load time, ensuring styles are available before component initialization
- Bundle maintains unminified format for field debugging while eliminating external dependencies
- Backward compatibility preserved - existing development workflow remains unchanged using standard `yarn build`

**Code Impact:**
- Modified: `vite.config.js` (added conditional build configuration with CSS inlining plugin)
- Modified: `src/index.js` (added CSS import for bundling)
- Modified: `package.json` (added `build:standalone` script)
- Added: `test-file-protocol.html` (comprehensive test file for file:// protocol validation)

**Technical Implementation:**
```javascript
// Standalone build configuration (vite.config.js:7-54)
if (isStandalone) {
  return {
    build: {
      base: './',
      cssCodeSplit: false,
      rollupOptions: {
        input: resolve(__dirname, 'src/index.js'),
        output: {
          format: 'iife',
          name: 'GramFrame',
          inlineDynamicImports: true,
          entryFileNames: 'gramframe.bundle.js'
        },
        plugins: [{
          name: 'inline-css',
          generateBundle(options, bundle) {
            // CSS injection logic
            jsFile.code = jsFile.code.replace('(function() {',
              `(function() {
  const style = document.createElement('style');
  style.textContent = ${JSON.stringify(cssContent)};
  document.head.appendChild(style);`)
          }
        }]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Build Commands:**
```bash
# Standard development build
yarn build

# Standalone file:// compatible build  
yarn build:standalone
```

**Testing Results:**
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ Passed
- Bundle generation: ✅ Single 185KB file created
- CSS injection: ✅ Verified in bundle output
- File protocol compatibility: ✅ Opens directly without server
- Multi-instance support: ✅ All three modes tested
- No CORS errors: ✅ Confirmed in browser console

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None

**Deployment Impact:**
This enables standalone HTML deployment for users who receive spectrogram files without web server infrastructure. Users can now simply open HTML files directly from their file system, making GramFrame suitable for field deployment scenarios and standalone documentation packages.

    tags:
      - 'v*.*.*'

# Tag validation with semantic versioning
if [[ ! $TAG =~ ^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$ ]]; then
  echo "❌ Invalid tag format. Expected format: v*.*.* (e.g., v1.0.0)"
  exit 1
fi

# Asset bundling with verification
tar -czf "gramframe-$VERSION.tar.gz" -C release-assets .

# Release creation with auto-generated notes
uses: actions/create-release@v1
with:
  tag_name: ${{ steps.validate-tag.outputs.tag }}
  release_name: "GramFrame v${{ steps.validate-tag.outputs.version }}"
  body_path: release-notes.md

# Notification system
curl -d "✅ GramFrame v$VERSION released successfully!" ntfy.sh/iancc2025
```

**Release Creation Process:**
```bash
# Example release workflow for maintainers
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
# GitHub Actions automatically:
# 1. Validates tag format
# 2. Runs typecheck and tests
# 3. Builds project
# 4. Bundles release assets
# 5. Creates GitHub release with notes
# 6. Sends completion notification
```

**Documentation Created:**
- **Release Process Guide:** Complete documentation in `docs/Release-Process.md` covering:

- **Multiple Formats:** Framework prepared for additional asset formats (zip, standalone builds)

**Simplified Implementation:**
Following user feedback to avoid confusion, simplified the release workflow to include only the standalone build:
- **Standalone-Only Build**: Only `yarn build:standalone` for file:// protocol compatibility
- **Bundle Validation**: Size verification (>100KB) and existence checks for `gramframe.bundle.js`
- **Simple Release Assets**: Just 4 files - bundle, HTML sample, test image, and README
- **Clear User Experience**: No confusing build options - one bundle that "just works"
- **File Protocol Focus**: Optimized for training material distribution per ADR-013

**Release Contents (Simplified):**
- `gramframe.bundle.js` - Complete standalone component (185KB)
- `index.html` - Ready-to-use sample page (double-click to open)
- `mock-gram.png` - Test spectrogram image
- `README.md` - Usage guide with integration examples

**Testing Results:**
- TypeScript checking: ✅ Passed (`yarn typecheck`)

**Task Reference:** GitHub Issue #111 (Add Version Display to Pan Mode Guidance UI)

**Summary:**
Successfully implemented build-time version injection system and added a subtle version display (v0.0.1) to the pan mode guidance panel, enabling support teams to easily identify which version of GramFrame users are running.

**Details:**
- **Build-Time Version Injection:** Extended `vite.config.js` to read version from `package.json` and inject it as global `__GRAMFRAME_VERSION__` constant using Vite's define configuration for both development and standalone builds
- **Version Utility Module:** Created `src/utils/version.js` with `getVersion()` function that safely accesses the injected version and `createVersionDisplay()` function for generating properly styled version elements
- **UI Integration:** Modified `createModeSwitchingUI` function in `src/components/ModeButtons.js` to automatically add version display to guidance panel as a positioned overlay in the bottom-right corner
- **Styling:** Added comprehensive CSS styling in `src/gramframe.css` with military-theme consistent design, supporting multiple positioning options (top/bottom, left/right corners)

**Key Architecture Changes:**
- Version injection works for both standard development builds (`yarn build`) and standalone IIFE builds (`yarn build:standalone`)
- Version display is automatically positioned as absolute overlay within guidance panel's relative positioning context
- Built-in fallback to "0.0.1" if version injection fails during development
- TypeScript-compatible implementation with proper JSDoc annotations and @ts-ignore directives for build-time globals

**Code Impact:**
- Modified: `vite.config.js` (added version reading from package.json and define configuration for both build types)
- Created: `src/utils/version.js` (version utility functions with configurable display options)
- Modified: `src/components/ModeButtons.js` (integrated version display into guidance panel creation)
- Modified: `src/gramframe.css` (added version display styling with positioning variants)
- Testing: All 59 existing tests pass, confirming no regression in functionality

**Output/Result:**
```javascript
// Version injection in vite.config.js for both builds
define: {
  __GRAMFRAME_VERSION__: JSON.stringify(version)
}

// Version display integration in ModeButtons.js
const versionDisplay = createVersionDisplay({ position: 'bottom-right' })
guidancePanel.appendChild(versionDisplay)

// CSS styling for subtle, non-intrusive display
.gram-frame-version {
  position: absolute;
  font-size: 9px;
  color: #666;
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);
  padding: 2px 4px;
  border-radius: 2px;
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
Initial TypeScript compilation errors resolved by adding optional parameter annotations and @ts-ignore directive for build-time injected global variable.

**Next Steps:**
None - version display is fully functional and ready for production use.
