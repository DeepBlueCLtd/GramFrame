# GramFrame Project Memory Bank

## Project Overview
GramFrame is a component for displaying and interacting with spectrograms. It provides a canvas-based display with time and frequency indicators, LED-style readouts, and interactive features for exploring spectrogram data.

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Bootstrapping + Dev Harness (Completed)
**Date: July 18, 2025**

#### Task 1.1: Create `debug.html` page that loads a fixed component instance
- Created basic HTML structure with component container
- Added styling for debug page layout
- Set up component initialization
- Implemented responsive layout with side-by-side component and diagnostics panels

#### Task 1.2: Hook up "Hello World" from component inside the debug page
- Added Hello World message to component (later removed when no longer needed)
- Created styling for the message
- Verified component rendering in the debug page

#### Task 1.3: Set up hot module reload and visible console logging for state
- Implemented HMR using Vite's `import.meta.hot` API
- Added detailed console logging for state changes
- Ensured proper state preservation during hot reloads
- Set up state listener for updating the debug page display

### Phase 2: Basic Layout and Diagnostics Panel (Partially Completed)
**Date: July 18, 2025**

#### Task 2.3: Load spectrogram image from config
- Implemented image loading from the sample image (`/sample/mock-gram.png`)
- Added responsive image resizing with window resize event handling
- Created proper handling for image dimensions
- Refactored state structure to separate natural and display dimensions

#### Task 2.4: Read and display min/max time/frequency
- Extracted config data from table
- Implemented coordinate calculations based on min/max values
- Added bounds checking for mouse coordinates
- Fixed axis orientation (frequency horizontal, time vertical)

#### Task 2.5: Add LED-style readout panel below image
- Created LED display components for time, frequency, and mode
- Implemented styling for LED displays
- Added update mechanism for LED values based on cursor position

## Additional Improvements
**Date: July 18, 2025**

### Responsive Layout
- Implemented side-by-side layout for component and diagnostics
- Added responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- Created scrollable diagnostics panel with improved styling

### State Structure Refactoring
- Eliminated duplication in state structure
- Separated natural image dimensions (`imageDetails`) from display dimensions (`displayDimensions`)
- Improved property naming for clarity and maintainability

### Coordinate Handling
- Fixed axis orientation (frequency horizontal, time vertical)
- Implemented proper scaling of coordinates based on image dimensions
- Added bounds checking and value normalization
- Improved precision with fixed decimal places for display

## Pending Tasks
**Date: July 18, 2025**

### Testing Infrastructure
- Add Playwright as a dev dependency (Task 2.1)
- Create test infrastructure and initial Playwright test (Task 2.2)
- Write tests for implemented features (Tasks 1.1.1, 1.2.1, 1.3.1, 2.3.1, 2.4.1, 2.5.1)

### Diagnostics Panel
- Complete implementation of diagnostics panel features (Task 2.6)
- Test diagnostics panel information accuracy (Task 2.6.1)

## Technical Decisions
**Date: July 18, 2025**

### State Management
- Decided to use a centralized state object with listener pattern
- Implemented state notifications for UI updates
- Structured state to avoid duplication of dimension properties

### Responsive Design
- Used flexbox for layout to ensure responsiveness
- Implemented window resize event handling for canvas and image scaling
- Ensured aspect ratio preservation during resizing

### Event Handling
- Added mouse move and click event listeners to the canvas
- Implemented coordinate calculations with bounds checking
- Created LED display updates based on cursor position
