**Task Reference:** GitHub Issue #100 (Implement Pan as a Mode Extending BaseMode)

**Summary:**
Successfully transformed pan functionality from a toggle overlay into a proper mode that extends BaseMode, resolving conflicts between pan mode and other drag operations. Pan is now the 4th interaction mode alongside Analysis, Harmonics, and Doppler, appearing as a dedicated button (↔) in the modes toolbar.

**Details:**
- **New PanMode Implementation:** Created `src/modes/pan/PanMode.js` extending BaseMode with complete lifecycle methods (activate, deactivate, handleMouseDown/Move/Up, handleMouseLeave)
- **Mode Registration:** Updated ModeFactory, types definitions, and ModeButtons to include 'pan' as the 4th available mode
- **Legacy Code Removal:** Eliminated pan-specific logic from events.js (146-171, 220-235, 256-264 lines) and main.js (_togglePan, _panImage methods)
- **Zoom Integration:** Added automatic pan mode disabling when zoom level ≤ 1.0, with graceful fallback to previous mode
- **State Management:** Added previousMode tracking and pan mode initial state, removed legacy panMode toggle flag
- **Testing Results:** All 59 existing tests pass, TypeScript compilation successful, no regressions detected

**Key Architecture Changes:**
- Pan mode conflicts resolved - users can now drag harmonics without pan mode interference  
- Pan functionality properly integrated into the modular mode system following ADR-008 patterns
- UI consistency maintained with pan button using same styling as other mode buttons
- Zoom-dependent mode switching ensures pan is only available when meaningful (zoom > 1:1)

**Code Impact:**
- Added: `src/modes/pan/PanMode.js` (200+ lines)  
- Modified: 6 files (ModeFactory.js, types.js, ModeButtons.js, events.js, main.js, state.js)
- Removed: ~80 lines of pan-specific legacy code
- CSS: Removed obsolete .gram-frame-pan-toggle.active styles

  fast: 5       // Shift + Arrow keys: 5-pixel increments
}
```

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None. TypeScript type checking passes and production build completes successfully.

- System documentation and code comments maintain `analysis` terminology
- Backward compatibility fully maintained

**Testing Results:**
- TypeScript checking passes with no errors

**Task Reference:** GitHub Issue #63 (Enhanced Frequency Axis with Denser Markers and Labels)

**Summary:**
Enhanced the frequency axis rendering to provide more granular frequency markers and labels, implementing intelligent 5Hz/2.5Hz interval spacing with visual hierarchy to improve spectrogram analysis usability.

**Details:**
- Analyzed current `renderFrequencyAxis` function in `src/components/table.js` (lines 389-434) that used fixed 5 evenly-spaced ticks
- Designed adaptive tick spacing algorithm that scales based on frequency range:
  * ≤50Hz range: 5Hz major, 2.5Hz minor intervals (as requested)
  * ≤100Hz range: 10Hz major, 5Hz minor intervals
  * ≤500Hz range: 25Hz major, 12.5Hz minor intervals  
  * >500Hz range: 50Hz major, 25Hz minor intervals
- Implemented intelligent positioning algorithm that aligns ticks to interval boundaries and prevents overlap
- Added fallback to original behavior for extremely dense cases (>maxTicks threshold)
- Created visual hierarchy with major ticks (8px height) with labels and minor ticks (4px height) without labels
- Made major tick labels slightly smaller (10px vs 12px) as requested in issue specification
- Preserved rate parameter scaling functionality (`displayFreq = freq / rate`)

**Output/Result:**
```javascript
// Key algorithm snippet from enhanced renderFrequencyAxis function
// Determine appropriate tick intervals based on frequency range
let majorInterval, minorInterval, maxTicks

if (freqRange <= 50) {
  // For small ranges, use 5Hz and 2.5Hz intervals as requested
  majorInterval = 5
  minorInterval = 2.5
  maxTicks = 200
} else if (freqRange <= 100) {
  // For medium ranges, use 10Hz and 5Hz intervals
  majorInterval = 10
  minorInterval = 5
  maxTicks = 100
}
// ... additional range handling
```

```css
/* New CSS classes added for visual hierarchy */
.gram-frame-axis-tick-major {
  stroke: #fff;
  stroke-width: 1;
}

.gram-frame-axis-tick-minor {
  stroke: #fff;
  stroke-width: 1;
}

.gram-frame-axis-label-major {
  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, sans-serif;
  font-size: 10px;  /* Slightly smaller as requested */
  fill: #fff;
  dominant-baseline: central;
}
```

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Ready for testing with various frequency ranges and potential fine-tuning based on user feedback. All tests passing (59/59) and development server running successfully.

**Agent:** Implementation Agent  
**Task Reference:** GitHub Issue #63 Enhancement - Adaptive Tick Spacing Algorithm

**Summary:**
Enhanced the frequency axis algorithm to use Paul Heckbert's "nice numbers" approach, making it truly adaptive to zoom levels and capable of handling large frequency ranges (1000Hz+) as requested.

**Details:**
- Researched best practices for adaptive axis tick spacing algorithms
- Identified the core issue: fixed 5Hz intervals regardless of zoom level or frequency range
- Implemented Paul Heckbert's "nice numbers" algorithm from Graphics Gems
- Algorithm now considers pixel density (targets ~80px between major ticks) and uses "nice" intervals (1, 2, 5 × 10^n)
- Replaced hardcoded breakpoints with dynamic calculation based on available width and frequency range
- Added intelligent minor tick calculation (1/2 or 1/5 of major interval depending on base)
- Preserves rate parameter functionality and existing visual hierarchy

**Output/Result:**
```javascript
// Core nice numbers algorithm implementation
function niceNum(range, round) {
  const exponent = Math.floor(Math.log10(range))
  const fraction = range / Math.pow(10, exponent)
  let niceFraction
  
  if (round) {
    if (fraction < 1.5) niceFraction = 1
    else if (fraction < 3) niceFraction = 2
    else if (fraction < 7) niceFraction = 5
    else niceFraction = 10
  } else {
    if (fraction <= 1) niceFraction = 1
    else if (fraction <= 2) niceFraction = 2
    else if (fraction <= 5) niceFraction = 5
    else niceFraction = 10
  }
  
  return niceFraction * Math.pow(10, exponent)
}
```

**Algorithm Test Results:**
- 50Hz range → 10Hz major, 2Hz minor intervals
- 1000Hz range → 200Hz major, 100Hz minor intervals  
- 2000Hz range → 500Hz major, 100Hz minor intervals
- Maintains consistent ~160-200px visual spacing across all ranges
- Properly handles rate parameter scaling and different image widths

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Algorithm now scales from tight zoomed-in views (2Hz intervals) to wide range views (500Hz intervals) while maintaining optimal visual density and "nice" human-readable numbers.
